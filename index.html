<p> It was going to be one of the most ambitious projects of its kind. No one had pulled off anything that required this level of logistics. The hype and build up to the roll-out was unprecedented. Major promises were made, and millions of dollars invested. It was a make or break moment. </p>

<p>I’m talking, of course, about the 2017 Fyre festival.</p>

<img src="fyre5.png" class="center">

<p> While the Fyre festival was a scam run by a fraudulent executive, there are many similarities to Healthcare.gov. Healthcare.gov was not a scam, far from it. But both ventures suffered from a culture that suppressed dissent and obscured reality. Both suffered from fatal groupthink where the group believed in the success of the mission even while individuals group members knew the truth.</p>

<p> Henry Chao was the Former Deputy CIO and Deputy Director (Ret.), Office of Information Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). He was one of the lead managers of the Healthcare.gov project. In listening to him recount the experience, I took three takeaways about how to either identify a failed IT project or signal to leadership that an IT project is failing.</p>

<p><b> 1. The leadership is disconnected from the work, and thus the leaders are unaware of the complexity of the project. </b></p>

<p>For those not experienced in managing or developing IT projects, there is a certain amount of belief in the magic of IT. It’s hard to distinguish between the complexity of a simple data search interface and for example, the Amazon market place. Even where the interface is relatively simple, the back end can be maddingly complex. Thus, it is critical that the stakeholders, particularly the ultimate leads and authority figures, understand how complex the project is so that they are prepared for the inevitable road blocks and can manage expectations, particularly public expectations. Henry wrote in response to an inquiry from our class that, “much of what was in our control was tested,” but that they didn’t have the details “needed to build… robust test cases with test data that mimicked the actual final requirements.” He further explained that, “[b]y the time we received enough of the requirements and the last part of the requirements that governed coordination with Medicaid eligibility rules for expansion and non-expansion states it was the end of August 2013.” Henry explains that the team did not fail in its attempt to test its minimally viable product, but that the complexity of the project was such that they couldn’t get the specifications and requirements they needed to develop and test a product until it was too late. Part of this problem is that the chain of command, particularly at the top, didn’t seem to fully comprehend the complexity of the software development challenge and how these different moving parts would slow down production. <b>My takeaway is that an IT project may fail if the leadership in the organization does not understand the complexity of the project.</b> Had Secretary of Health and Human Services had a voice in the room that could speak the IT language, there may have been a better understanding of the challenge the project faced.</p>

<p>With the Fyre festival, it seems that Fyre CEO Billy McFarland had no clue how running a luxury musical festival on a foreign island with no infrastructure was an incredibly complex undertaking. His self-delusion flowed through the organization. While those doing the actual work on the ground could see the impossibility of their individual tasks, the people in the top continued to embrace the fantasy. </p>

<p><b>2.	Failure will be more likely when politics dictate strategic project decisions.</b></p>

<p>Every government project will have to deal with some level of political maneuvering, even if not partisan. Because the people working on Healthcare.gov believed in the righteousness of the project, and because the political stakes were so high, the program was not treated with the professional care it deserved. At one point, Henry told us that “people don’t want to hear about problems, so [we] don’t raise them,” and that he didn’t want to get disinvited to important briefing meetings by always complaining. The leadership cultivated an environment that did not allow for dissent or confronting bad reports. This caused people to stop raising problems. <b>But the pressure underlying that cultural problem was political.</b> No one wanted to deal with the political consequences of setbacks. Henry told us he met with the White House 36 times, but his warnings about project roadblocks were ignored. My conclusion is that the politics were driving the culture because the political consequences of the project were so significant. <b>What I take from this is that leadership needs to make clear that the political consequences for the project are separate from the work.</b> They need to cultivate a climate that is honest and upfront with challenges, and let the political leaders worry about the political consequences.</p>

<p>Even a private, non-IT project like the Fyre festival suffered from the same problem. The Fyre festival logistics team felt such immense pressure because of the media attention on the festival and the hard deadline to meet. This, in turn, created a sort of political pressure placed upon them that exceeded the delusions of their CEO.</p>

<p> <b>3.	There needs to be objective oversight and stress tests.</b></p>

<p>Henry told us that the Helathcare.gov team was testing throughout. But the leadership had not really created a way to stress test the project at regular intervals. They brought in outside consultants, but then the leadership ignored them! Instead, leaders relied on reassurances from the different project teams that the fears of the auditing consultants were unfounded. The leaders should have continued to engage the outside consultants to provide objective oversight and testing. <b>There needs to be a way to objectively review progress to prevent biases and groupthink from hiding or diminishing real threats to the success of the project.</b> By stress test, I mean that leaders need to be able to review what project teams are doing and make objective assessments about their progress, rather than rely on their assurance that all is well. </p>

<p>The Fyre festival had no expert oversight or support. Had the CEO not been a crook, he might have brought in an outside expert to review the project and its progress and offer frank assessments on the project’s viability at different stages. </p>

<p><u>Do any of these lessons relate to frameworks or theories you have learned in other HKS classes?</u></p>

<p>Some of this relates to frameworks and theories I have learned in other HKS classes. In Maximizing Human Capital, we discussed the cultural norms among the engineers and leaders at NASA that suppressed dissent and led to the Challenger disaster. There, the contractor engineers received immense pressure from their leaders because they did not want to jeopardize their NASA contracts. Similarly, the NASA leadership was biased toward launching, and thus gave minimal attention to dissent. I also noted in that scenario that there was almost no diversity in any room where a decision was made.<p>

<p><u>Who do you think is responsible for those failures and how, had you been part of the development team, might you have alerted HHS to these possible failures?</u><p>

<p> I think the HHS leadership team and the White House leadership team were both responsible for the failure. HHS was responsible because the project was essentially an HHS project. And the White House was most invested in the project’s success given that it was the President’s signature issue. Thus, it was incumbent upon those leaders to establish cultural norms, insulate the project from political consequences, and run objective evaluations of the project’s progress.</p>

<p>Had I been in part of the development team, I’m not sure I would have been able to see that the program would fail. It was so vast and complex, with so many different parts, that I likely would have only seen a small piece of it. If I felt that piece was subject to failure, I would have written a memorandum explaining my reasons and tried to move that up the chain. I don’t know if that would have made any difference based on what Henry report to us. Had I been in the leadership of the development team such that I could understand the project’s shortcomings on a grander scale, then I would have tried to make this clear to the agency and White House leadership, again by making my concerns clear in writing. If they were ignored, I would take it as high as I could go. If I was still being ignored, I might have looked for alternative approaches, such as alerting the inspector general’s office. But to be honest, I cannot claim that had I been in that situation, I would have been able to do anything to stop the failure. The key is for leadership to put the right systems in place and develop the right culture so that the leaders are able to confront the realities of the project.</p>

<p>If I had been working for the Fyre festival, I might have called the FBI at the start. </p>
